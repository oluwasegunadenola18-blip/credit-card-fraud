# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques while handling highly imbalanced data.

## 📊 Dataset
- Anonymized credit card transactions
- Features V1–V28 are PCA transformed
- Target variable:
  - 0 = Legitimate
  - 1 = Fraud

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature scaling
4. Handling class imbalance with SMOTE
5. Model training using Random Forest
6. Model evaluation using Recall and ROC-AUC

## 📈 Results
The Random Forest model achieved high recall and strong ROC-AUC score, demonstrating effective fraud detection.

## ✅ Conclusion
Machine learning can effectively detect fraudulent credit card transactions when proper preprocessing and imbalance handling techniques are applied.
